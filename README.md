# **Theme Switcher (Light/Dark Mode)**

## **Overview**

A simple beginner-friendly project where you build a Light/Dark theme toggle using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
Clicking a button switches the entire page theme instantly by adding/removing a CSS class.

No frameworks. No Tailwind. Pure fundamentals.
